# Game-Sales-Analysis
## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to uncover insights into the gaming industry's dynamics over the past decades by analyzing video game sales data. We seek to understand the drives behind video games success by exploring trends in genre popularity, platform performance, game sales, and regional sales differences and how consumer preferences have evolved.
## Objectives
- Sales Performance Analysis: Identify the top-selling games and platforms.
- Genre Popularity: Analyze the popularity of game genres across different regions.
- Publisher Sales Comparison: Compare the sales by publishers over the years.
- Regional Sales Analysis: Examine how game sales vary by region.
## Data Source
This analysis dataset was sourced from Kaggle's "Video Game Sales" dataset, which includes video game sales information across Japan, Europe, North America, and other regions, spanning several decades. It features data on genres, game titles, sales figures, platforms, and publishers.
## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel due to its robust data manipulation, calculation, and visualization capabilities. Key steps in the analysis process included:

- Data Cleaning: Standardizing game names, filtering out incomplete records, and handling missing values.
- Data Aggregation: Using PivotTables to summarize sales data by publisher, platform, region, and genre.
- Visualization: Creating charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns in the data, including line charts for time series analysis, stacked column charts for sales composition, and pie charts for market share analysis.
